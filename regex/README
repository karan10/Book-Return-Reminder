regex is an alternative to the re package in the Python standard library. It is
intended to act as a drop in replacement, and one day to replace re. regex is
supported on Python v2.5 to v2.7 and v3.1 to v3.4.

To build and install regex for your default Python run 
    
    python setup.py install
    
To install regex for a specific version run setup.py with that interpreter, e.g.
